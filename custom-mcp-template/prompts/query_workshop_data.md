# Query Workshop Sample Data

Help me explore the workshop sample data in Unity Catalog.

Use the `execute_dbsql` tool to:
1. First, show me all databases: `SHOW DATABASES`
2. Then, show me tables in the workshop catalog: `SHOW TABLES IN mcp_workshop_<username>.default`
3. Preview the first 10 rows of each table you find

Present the data in clear, formatted tables. Explain what each table contains based on the column names and sample data.
